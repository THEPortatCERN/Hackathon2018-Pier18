SUMMARY
This report presents the results achieved in 2013 with humanitarian funds directed to the organizations
and actions in the Syria Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan (SHARP) and Syria Regional
Response Plan (RRP). Funding for the actions and organizations in these two plans constituted the
major part of humanitarian funding for the Syria crisis in 2013, and the destination for 67% of the funds
so far arising from the first Kuwait Pledging Conference in January 2013.

Within the Syrian Arab Republic, humanitarian actors scaled up and aimed to reach a target (revised at
mid-year) of at least 6.8 million people in need. They largely succeeded, and in some cases surpassed
the mid-year targets as needs continued to mount. On-going insecurity and the use of siege as a
weapon of war have delivery of relief supplies and services to all in need extremely difficult.


Organizations working in the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector provided 10 million
people with safe drinking water.



The health sector provided 3.6 million people with health consultations, treatments and
interventions, plus 2.3 million people with emergency health kits, burn kits and other kits. They
reached 1,100,505 children with measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations and 840,752 children with
polio vaccinations, and fielded 51 mobile medical teams, reaching 246,546 internally displaced
children with medical check-ups.



The food and agriculture sector reached 4.02 million people (out of a targeted 5.040 million
people), of whom 3.4 million people with direct food assistance, 89,000 people with agricultural
and livestock support, and 536,000 Palestine refugees with food and cash grant assistance.



The sector for shelter and household items (‘non-food items’ or NFI) provided household items to
4.86 million people (surpassing its target of 3.67 million); rehabilitated 151 collective shelters
(with rehabilitation of another 52 under way); and delivered cash assistance to 564,465 people.



The education sector surpassed its targets, delivering school supplies to 1,500,000 conflictaffected children and arranging remedial education and catch-up classes for 310,000 children.



In early recovery and livelihoods, 55,000 families with disrupted livelihoods received support.
Organizations working in this sector reached 45,000 internally displaced families in the 14
governorates (30,000 already reached, 15,000 in process), providing 30,000 quilts (15,400
already distributed, 15,000 are in process), 4,000 rugs and mats, and 67,000 items of summer
and winter clothing for women and children (25,500 distributed, 41,000 in process). 10,500
children in Homs received winter underwear and 8,000 hygiene kits were distributed in several
governorates. Around 5,000 local labourers were employed in a cash-for-work scheme for solid
waste removal and disposal in Homs, Aleppo, Deir Ezzor and Tartous, improving living conditions
for 700,000 internally displaced people.



Protection and community services programmes reached over 150,000 people, through eight
community centres (in Aleppo, Damascus, Rural Damascus, Dara’a, Sweida and Tartous
Governorates) offering a range of legal and social services including psycho-social activities in a
3

protective and calm space, and a community mobilization programme in eight Governorates.
Organizations provided psycho-social support for 460,000 children, helping them cope with the
distress and disruption to their lives resulting from violence and displacement. More than 78,655
survivors of gender-based violence were assisted with psycho-social support, psychological first
aid, medical counselling and vocational skills programmes through mobile teams and clinics.


Nutrition sector partners were able to reach more than 500,000 children and more than 300,000
pregnant and lactating women, for screening, prevention or treatment of malnutrition and
counselling and education for caretakers on nutrition. 290,417 children (age 6-59 months) were
screened for malnutrition; more than 500,000 children were provided with multi-micronutrients for
the prevention of malnutrition; over 491,936 children aged 6-59 months received complementary
food including Plumpy’Doz, Plumpy’Sup and high-energy biscuits; 62,682 moderately
malnourished children were provided with Plumpy’Sup treatment for malnutrition; and 13,778
children were treated for severe malnutrition with plumpynuts, F-75 and F-100.



The logistics cluster has transported over 30,000 cubic meters of aid cargo vital to shelter,
nutrition, health, WASH, and agriculture programmes on behalf of 16 humanitarian organizations
in Syria. Over 70,000 cubic meters of humanitarian cargo was stored for 16 organizations at the
cluster’s common storage locations in Syria. The cluster supported over 30 joint humanitarian
convoys, transporting aid cargo to the governorates of Idleb, Aleppo, Homs, Daraa, Hama,
Raqqa, Rural Damascus, and Hassakeh. Two primary storage hubs—Safita (near Tartous) and
Sahnaya (Rural Damascus)—provided a total storage capacity of 8,060 square meters for the
humanitarian community. In spite of the complex security environment and the changes in
logistics needs this entailed, the logistics cluster met 440 out of 467 service requests for storage
and transport in 2013.



The emergency telecommunications cluster installed over 200 VHF/HF radios for six
humanitarian organizations, and activated a satellite receiver in Damascus for data and voice
transmission.



To handle the complexity of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, the coordination sector has
promoted maximum effectiveness of humanitarian response through information management,
analysis and dissemination of information, assessment of needs, coordination of inter-sector
response planning, monitoring of results, communication and advocacy, emergency
preparedness and contingency planning, facilitation of inter-agency convoys and initiatives, and
resource mobilization. The sector coordinated 42 inter-agency convoys to reach people in need
in hard-to-access locations.



The staff safety and security sector conducted regular risk assessments, enhanced the physical
security of UN premises in all locations, established 24/7 radio rooms at both UN hubs (Homs
and Tartus), provided security support for UN convoys and missions to the field including crossline areas, and deployed six fully equipped armour-protected vehicles in Damascus, Homs,
Tartus and Qamishly to support aid delivery.



Overall expenditure of funds received for SHARP programmes in 2013 is estimated at 86%
by 31 December 2013.

In 2013 the number of Syrians fleeing their homeland increased dramatically, making this one of the
largest refugee crises in the world. Applications for asylum have been submitted in 90 countries. By 30
November 2013, nearly 2.2 million refugees from Syria had been registered in the Arab Republic of
Egypt (Egypt), the Republic of Iraq (Iraq), the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan), the Lebanese
Republic (Lebanon), and the Republic of Turkey (Turkey). During 2013, UNHCR registered some 1.7
million Syrian refugees in the region, with registration serving as the entry point for Syrians to be
documented and their vulnerabilities assessed for protection purposes.
The key assistance delivered to refugees and affected host communities in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey,
Iraq and Egypt included:



More than 2 million refugees in the region have received food assistance, including in-kind food
such as welcome meals, food rations and/or daily micronutrient-fortified snacks, as well as valuebased vouchers for purchasing food. Food vouchers inject millions of dollars into the local
market economy.



Syrian refugees have made more than a million visits to primary health care facilities and more
than 1,500,000 vaccinations have been given against measles and other diseases.



836,000 people have received safe drinking water through delivery, storage facilities and
connection to the water network. About 626,517 people benefitted from sanitation facilities and
services including access to adequate latrines, shower facilities and solid waste collection and
disposal services.



339,000 children have benefitted from psycho-social support and activities. 190 child-/youth/women-friendly spaces have been established in camps and host communities. 9,600
unaccompanied or at-risk children have been identified and assisted.



The education sector has reached 440,000 children (out of a target of 810,000) with educational
assistance. 612 schools have been assisted with infrastructure, renovations and refurbishments.
More than 12,400 teachers and other support staff received training



The education sector has reached 668,150 children (out of a target of 810,000) with educational
assistance. Some 670 schools have been assisted with infrastructure, renovations and
refurbishments. More than 8,800 teachers and other support staff received training.



Shelter sector organizations distributed more than 144,000 tents, temporary and emergency
shelters to vulnerable families, and 840,000 individuals benefitted from shelter assistance,
including cash assistance for rents. Overall, 840,000 refugees received various kinds of shelter
assistance (out of a target of roughly 1,600,000 refugees).



Approximately 1,600,000 refugees were reached with support for household items and 195,714
cash assistance distributions were made to support refugee families cover other basic needs. An
extensive assistance package was rolled out across the region to help refugees cope with harsh
winter conditions.

(All funding figures in this document, unless otherwise noted, are taken from the Financial Tracking Service (fts.unocha.org) on 31 December
2013. FTS data comes from donor and recipient organizations. FTS on-line data are updated daily according to new reports including end-ofyear reports; by 15 January 2014 the on-line funding figures for the Syria crisis in 2013 are likely to differ from those in this document.)

Donors for Syria crisis humanitarian response
More than 65 donor countries have provided funding for the Syria humanitarian response since the
beginning of 2012. Donors increased their funding for the Syria crisis from 2012 to 2013 from $963
million in 2012 to $4.45 billion in 2013. The donors with major increases include: the United States
($1.16 billion in 2013 for the Syria crisis, compared to $189 million in 2012), the United Kingdom ($381
million in 2013, $72 million in 2012), the European Commission ($732 million in 2013, $109 million in
2012), the State of Kuwait ($324 million in 2013, $8 million in 2012), and Germany ($312 million in 2013,
$99 million in 2012).
In addition, almost $200 million has been mobilized from private donors since the beginning of 2012,
including large amounts from United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) National Committees and
private fundraising campaigns in Europe and the Middle East.

SHARP and RRP requirements and funding
These two inter-agency plans do not encompass all humanitarian response for the Syria crisis, but they
do encompass the major part of international humanitarian response, its requirements and its funding.
The first RRP and SHARP were launched in March and June 2012 respectively, with combined
requirements of $264 million, later raised to $836 million. Funding response from donors in 2012 was
$560 million (67% of requirements).
For 2013, the total requested for Syria and neighbouring countries was initially $1.56 billion, of which
one-third was for needs inside Syria ($520 million) and two-thirds for needs in neighbouring countries
($1.04 billion). By mid-2013, requirements increased to $4.39 billion ($1.41 billion for Syria and $2.98
billion for neighbouring countries). Funding mounted steadily in response, and by year’s end, more than
$3.03 billion—69% of the required total—had been raised by the international community.

In addition to funding for activities outlined in the SHARP and RRP, official and private donors
contributed more than $1.8 billion in 2012 and 2013 to other activities and organizations, including to the
Red Cross/Red Crescent movement and bilateral aid to the governments of the refugee-hosting
countries.

Expenditure rate
The following table shows indicative 2013 expenditure rates for most organizations in the SHARP and
the largest organizations (in terms of requirements) in the RRP. Expenditure figures are unofficial
snapshots, since the financial year has only just closed and formal year-end figures are not yet available.
(Only some SHARP and RRP organizations are shown, as it has not yet been possible to obtain
expenditure information for all 95 organizations in the 2013 SHARP and RRP, and for the many others
that have received funds for the Syria crisis response outside the SHARP and RRP.) Expenditure rates
must be understood in the context of when funds were received: for example, no less than $360 million
of SHARP and RRP funding has been committed just since 1 November 2013—12% of the total
SHARP/RRP funding for 2013—and by agreement with the donors is to be partly spent in 2014.

*Note: some figures for funding per agency differ from those in the tables in the annex, because of different time scales used to
calculate expenditure.
a
Overall, more than one-fifth of UNICEF funding for the Syria crisis in 2013 came in during the last two months of 2013. In
particular, for actions inside Syria, more than a quarter (40.6 million) of the funds arrived in the last two months of the year.
b
WFP expenditures include not only funds spent, but also funds that have been allocated to projects and yet to be disbursed.
c

A number of contributions were granted to FAO only towards the end of 2013, which explains the relatively low level of
expenditures. The use of such funds will be carried over into 2014.
d
Significant funding received in the third quarter of 2013 and several contracts running into 2014 as per agreement with donors.
e
Estimates as of end December; some funding to be spent in 2014 as per agreement with donors.

Kuwait Conference I pledges
At the Kuwait Pledging Conference in January 2013, 43 donors pledged $1.54 billion for the Syria crisis
humanitarian response. By the end of 2013, over $1.18 billion (76%) of the amount pledged at the
Kuwait Conference was committed or paid, constituting a quarter of all humanitarian funding for Syria
and neighbouring countries in 2013. Thirty-four donors have fully disbursed or committed their pledges.
The top ten major pledges that have been fully committed are: Kuwait ($300 million), the United States of
America ($155 million), the European Commission ($133 million), the United Kingdom ($81 million),
Saudi Arabia ($78 million), Japan ($65 million), Norway ($38 million), Canada ($25 million), and Sweden
($23 million). The ad hoc consortium of the International Islamic Charitable Organization and its NGO
partners raised $116 million.
67% ($785 million) of the commitments arising from the first Kuwait Conference was directed to the
organisations and activities in the SHARP and RRP.

In addition to the announcements made at the conference on 30 January 2013, most donors have
committed much more over the course of the year than they pledged at the conference. Donors
pledging at the first Kuwait Conference committed $2.7 billion for the Syria crisis in addition to the
funding they announced at the conference itself. The pledges announced by Australia, Canada,
Denmark, the European Commission, Germany, Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States
at the conference represent only 20% or less of their overall commitments for the Syria crisis in 2013.
For other donors such as Norway, Sweden or Japan, their Kuwait Conference pledges represent about
50% of their overall commitments in 2013 for the Syria crisis. Requirements nearly tripled between the
time of the first Kuwait Pledging Conference and the mid-year revision of the SHARP and RRP.

Syria crisis funding in the context of global humanitarian funding for 2012 and 2013
Total funding for the Syria crisis amounts to 30% of all global humanitarian funding in 2013 ($4.4 billion
out of $14.6 billion). The two inter-agency coordinated plans for the Syria crisis (SHARP and RRP
combined) were 69% funded in 2013 and 67% in 2012, above the average funding of other inter-agency
appeals which were funded, on average, at 62% in both 2012 and 2013. The combined funding for the
SHARP and RRP amounts to 35% of the total funding for 2013 coordinated appeals ($3.03 billion out of
$8.6 billion). The unmet requirements of the SHARP and the RRP represent currently 25% of the overall
unmet requirements for all coordinated appeals in 2013 ($1.35 billion out of $5.3 billion).

since it was established in 2012. As of end December 2013, over $44 million had been allocated to
NGOs, UN agencies and the Red Cross/Red Crescent to support 140 projects in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon
and Iraq. NGOs have received 62% of all funding allocated to date, and almost three-quarters of funding
has supported priority activities in shelter/NFI (23%), health (19%), WASH (17%) and multi-sector
support for refugees (13%). The ERF allocated funds to the organizations best positioned to implement
the most urgent actions at a given time.

HOW HUMANITARIAN FUNDS FOR THE SYRIA CRISIS WERE SPENT – 2013 SHARP AND RRP

SHARP ACHIEVEMENTS PER SECTOR
Humanitarian actors across sectors have scaled up the humanitarian response, reaching more
beneficiaries across the country. This scale-up was made possible through strengthened collaboration
with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and line ministries, and expanded partnerships with Syrian charities,
enhanced field outreach, and additional human resources capacity through the deployment of larger
numbers of experienced staff.
Significant efforts have been made to reach people who have been forced to flee their homes and
communities assisting them, in hard-to-reach areas. This has been mainly through increased local
partnerships and enhanced field presence through the establishment of UN hubs which have been the
key to achieving predictability and regularity of humanitarian access across a wider geographical reach,
and to complement regular assistance programmes. A special focus has been to reach people in need
in hot-spot areas across lines of fighting within the country.
Below are the figures per sector of the number of people reached with key assistance, vis-à-vis the
targets set at mid-2013 . (The source of all of the following implementation information is the sector lead
agencies.)
